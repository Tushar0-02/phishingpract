        <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
        <P>Phishing is a cyberattack method where malicious actors attempt to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data. These attacks often involve impersonating a trustworthy entity, like a bank, government agency, or well-known company, to gain the victim's trust.<BR><BR><BR>

            ### Common Types of Phishing:<BR>

            2. **Spear Phishing**: Targeted attacks directed at specific individuals or organizations, often using personalized information to appear more convincing.<BR>
            3. **Smishing**: Phishing via SMS or text messages.<BR>
            4. **Vishing**: Voice phishing, where attackers make phone calls pretending to be from trusted organizations.<BR>
            5. **Clone Phishing**: Duplicating a legitimate message but replacing links or attachments with malicious ones.<BR>
            6. **Pharming**: Redirecting users to fake websites by compromising DNS servers or infecting devices.<BR><BR><BR>

            2. **Verify the sender**: Contact the organization directly to confirm the legitimacy of the request.<BR>
